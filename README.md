## 🏥 Prior Authorization Automation Process

This project automates the Prior Authorization (PA) workflow to enhance the speed, accuracy, and efficiency of healthcare approvals. It is designed to reduce manual intervention in verifying, submitting, and tracking prior authorization requests by integrating frontend interaction with backend logic using modern web technologies.
